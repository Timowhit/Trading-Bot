The Stock market is inherently risky, please continue at your own risk and know what works for me may not provide you with the same results.

Note: If the project isn't running, check file directory and your visual editor will provide solutions to fix file location issues.

The only three files you should be touching is Trader.py, Trade_Strat.py, and Config.py.
You will input your login credentials into Config.py, pretty cut and dry.
Trade_strat.py is used to modify the graph indicators to tell you whether to buy, sell, or hold --- you shouldn't have to modify this file but you can to fine-tune this project to your liking.
Trader.py is the file used to select which stocks you would like to look at. Lines 25-29 will say stocks.append("~~~") and you fill in the ticker symbol. feel free to add more lines or remove unused lines as desired.
